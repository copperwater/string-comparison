# string-comparison

A program to evaluate lines in files based on the longest common substring and subsequence.
Can compare a single line to a file, a file against itself, or all lines between two files.

Thresholds can be specified to filter out lines that don't have a common substring or subsequence of a certain length or a certain percentage of either string.
